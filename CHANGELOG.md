* Relative lack of progress is due to not knowing what kind of game I want to make. 
I'm still pretty unsure, but I think it's best to make some prototypes, and find out what's fun that way.
* Due to this, I have switched up a lot of the ROADMAP.md
* Added building.py
* Updated how file paths are found
* Updated the tile sets

## 21/12/21 11:13
* Lack of progress is due to procrastination, will try to do actual work over the holidays

## 03/01/22 23:07

## 07/01/22 02:44

* Commented out paths.py. Will likely delete soon

## 03/02/22 01:11
* Due to massive amounts of procrastination, and a sprinkling of prelims and database stuff, little work has been done.
