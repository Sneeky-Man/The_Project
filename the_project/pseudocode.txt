2.2.2) Delete any existing tables in the database
2.2.3) Create the unit table
2.2.4) Assign the connection to the conn variable
2.2.5) Setup a list of objects to be added to the database
2.2.6) Using the list of objects, extract the info from the objects and add that to the database.
2.2.6) Return the conn variable

3  ) Initialise the window as GameWindow
3.1) Set conn variable from step 2
3.2) Initialise all variables as None

4.4.6   ) Convert all tiles on the unit layer into buildings
4.4.6.1 ) Loop for each tile in the unit layer.
4.4.6.2 )    Search the database using the units name and tier
4.4.6.3 )    If the tiles team is "Blue"
4.4.6.4 )       Setup the building using the info from the search, as well as using the blue texture and blue team name
4.4.6.5 )    End If
4.4.6.6 )    Else if the tiles team is "Red"
4.4.6.7 )        Setup the building using the info from the search, as well as using the red texture and red team name
4.4.6.8 )    End If
4.4.6.9 )    Else
4.4.6.10)        Log an error.
4.4.6.11)    End Else
4.4.6.12) End Loop


5  ) Run Arcade
